SC_MODULE
Used to declare a class-like construct called a module, which interacts with other modules through 'wires'.

SC_CTOR
The 'constructor' for a module.

sc_in_clk
Essentially a publicly accessible variable that governs the behavior of a module in behaving as a clock.

sc_in
Essentially a publicly accessible variable for a module that can be used to define behaviors.

sc_out
Essentially a publicly accessible variable that outputs information from a module.

sc_signal
An abstracrt wire over which a signal is being transmitted.

.read()
Reads the value assigned to a sc_in/out "wire" (kind of like a pipe).

.write(value)
Writes "value" to a sc_in/out "wire" (kind of like a pipe).

sc_time_stamp()
Returns the current time within the simulation's clock.

// MODULES TUTORIAL

	* Modules contain the following...
		- Ports
		- Internal Variables
		- Constructor
		- Internal Methods
	* Modules declared with SC_MODULE (module_name)
		- Alternatively: class module_name : sc_module
	* Ports are used for communicating outside of a module...
		- sc_in, sc_out, sc_inout
	* Signals are used for communicating within a module
		- sc_signal type variable;
	* Signals are connected to ports like below...
		module.port_name(signal_name);
